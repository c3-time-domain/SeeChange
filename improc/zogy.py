def zogy_subtract(image_ref, image_new, psf_ref, psf_new, noise_ref, noise_new, flux_ref, flux_new, dx=None, dy=None):
    """Perform ZOGY image subtraction.

    This algorithm is based on Zackay et al. 2016 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...830...27Z/abstract).
    It filters the new image with the PSF of the reference, and the reference image with the PSF of the new image
    (which makes it symmetric for switching them) and divides by a normalization factor (in Fourier space)
    that accounts for frequencies where there is less information.
    This division makes sure the result is stable on all frequencies (no ringing as in deconvolution methods).

    In addition to the subtracted image, it also calculates the subtraction PSF, and the "score" image,
    which is the subtraction image match-filtered with its PSF. This image is normalized such that
    any peak found in the score image has a value that is equivalent to the S/N of that detection.

    Besides the classical score image (which is optimal assuming background dominated noise), the function also
    returns the corrected score image, which takes into account the noise from bright sources.

    The function also applies the astrometric noise correction when calculating score_corr, but only if
    dx and dy are given (and if they are non-zero).
    These values are... TODO: finish this

    The last two outputs (alpha, alpha_std) represent a PSF-photometry measurement of the
    flux in the subtracted image. This is equivalent to placing a PSF at each point of the image
    and calculating the best fit normalization that fits the PSF to the pixel values.

    Another way to think about the flux normalizations is as the flux-based zero-point of the image
    (the transmission of atmosphere & optics, quantum efficiency, and exposure time).
    In many cases the reference flux normalization would be 1.0, and used relative to the flux_new.
    The new flux normalization will often be relative to the flux_ref (which is often set to 1.0)
    and will be used to scale the overall brightness normalization between images.
    E.g., if the reference has a total exposure time X and the new image has X/10 then we might set
    flux_ref=1 and flux_new=1/10 (assume the same system and identical sky).
    Measuring the relative flux normalization can be done, e.g., by cross matching stars in each image
    and calculating the average ratio of their fluxes (hence, zero-point).

    NOTES:
     * images must be registered (aligned and distortion corrected to sub-pixel level). They must
       have the same size (use NaNs to pad areas of the image that are not overlapping).
     * They should also be background subtracted and gain corrected, i.e., in units of electrons,
       such that the noise is Poissonian (the variance is equal to the value of each pixel).
     * The background noise is input to this function (including the noise RMS of the sky and read noise,
       but no source noise!).
     * Users may input a scalar background RMS or a map of the background RMS with the same shape as the image.
     * The "flux-based zero point" is the flux needed to provide a S/N=1, measure in a matched-filter image with
       the correct PSF. For a sum(P)=1 normalized PSF, use 1/sqrt(sum(P**2)/B), where B is the background variance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_ref : numpy.ndarray
        The reference image, background subtracted, in units of electrons (gain corrected).
    image_new : numpy.ndarray
        The new image, background subtracted, in units of electrons (gain corrected).
    psf_ref : numpy.ndarray
        The PSF of the reference image. Must be normalized to have unit sum. Will be zero-padded to size of images.
    psf_new : numpy.ndarray
        The PSF of the new image. Must be normalized to have unit sum. Will be zero-padded to size of images.
    noise_ref : float or numpy.ndarray
        The noise RMS of the background in the reference image (given as a map or a single average value).
        Does not include source noise!
    noise_new : float or numpy.ndarray
        The noise RMS of the background in the new image (given as a map or a single average value).
        Does not include source noise!
    flux_ref : float
        The flux-based zero point of the reference (the flux at which S/N=1).  [WUT?  The flux at
        which S/N=1 has nothing to do with the zeropoint!]
    flux_new : float
        The flux-based zero point of the new image (the flux at which S/N=1).
    dx : float
        The measure of the uncertainty in the astrometric registration in the x direction.
        This is in units of pixels. If given as None (default), will ignore astrometric noise.
    dy : float
        The measure of the uncertainty in the astrometric registration in the y direction.
        This is in units of pixels. If given as None (default), will use the value of dx,
        which will be either None (so no astrometric noise correction) or a float value,
        which is applied to both x and y equally.
