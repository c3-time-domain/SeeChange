# NOTE -- this test gets killed on github actions; googling about a bit
# suggests that it uses too much memory.  Given that it launches two
# image processes tasks, and that we still are allocating more memory
# than we think we should be, this is perhaps not a surprise.  Put in an
# env var that will cause it to get skipped on github actions, but to be
# run by default when run locally.  This env var is set in the github
# actions workflows.
