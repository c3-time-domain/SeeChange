# NOTE -- this next test gets killed on github actions; googling about a bit
# suggests that it uses too much memory.  Given that it launches two
# image processes tasks, and that we still are allocating more memory
# than we think we should be, this is perhaps not a surprise.  Put in an
# env var that will cause it to get skipped on github actions, but to be
# run by default when run locally.  This env var is set in the github
# actions workflows.
#
# ...while the memory has been reduced a while back, for reasons I don't
# understand, if you run this test in the context of all the other tests,
# it hangs on the R/B step.  If you run this test all by itself, it
# does not hang.  So, for now, keep skipping it on github, and run it
# individually manually.

# The user and admin_user fixtures are included not because they are needed,
# but because setting a breakpoint at the end of this test and running it
# is a convenient way to set something up for playing around with the
# web ap interactively.  Including those users as fixtures doesn't slow
# the test down significantly, but does mean that every time I want to
# do this, I don't have to remember to put the users there in addition
# to putting in the breakpoint.
