## Testing

Tests are an integral part of the development process. 
We run mostly unit tests that test specific parts of the code, 
but a few integration tests are also included (end-to-end tests). 
We plan to add some regression tests that verify the results 
of the pipeline are consistent with previous code versions. 

### Running tests

To run the tests, simply run the following command from the root directory of the project:

```bash
pytest
```

To run the tests in a dockerized environment, see the setup.md file, under "Running tests". 

### Test caching and data folders

Some of our tests require large datasets (mostly images). 
We include a few example images in the repo itself, 
but most of the required data is lazy downloaded from 
the appropriate servers (e.g., from Noirlab). 

To avoid downloading the same data over and over again, we cache the
data in the `data/cache` folder.  To make sure the downloading process
works as expected, users can choose to delete this folder. (One may also
need to delete the `tests/temp_data` folder, if tests were interrupted.
Ideally, the tests don't depend on anything specific in there, but there
may be things left behind.)  In the tests, the path to this folder is
given by the `cache_dir` fixture.

Note that the persistent data, that comes with the 
repo, is anything else in the `data` folder, 
which is pointed to by the `persistent_dir` fixture. 

Finally, the working directory for local storage, 
which is referenced by the `FileOnDiskMixin.local_path` 
class variable, is defined in the test config YAML file, 
and can be accessed using the `data_dir` fixture. 
This folder is systematically wiped when the tests
are completed. 

### Running tests on github actions

In the https://github.com/c3-time-domain/SeeChange repository, we have set up some github actions to automatically run tests upon pushes to main (which should never happen) and upon pull requests.  These tests run from the files in `tests/docker-compose.yaml`.  For them to run, some docker images must exist in the github repository at `ghcr.io/c3-time-domain`.  As of this writing, the images needed are:
* `ghcr.io/c3-time-domain/upload-connector:[tag]`
* `ghcr.io/c3-time-domain/postgres:[tag]`
* `ghcr.io/c3-time-domain/seechange:[tag]`
* `ghcr.io/c3-time-domain/conductor:[tag]`
* `ghcr.io/c3-time-domain/seechange-webap:[tag]`
where `[tag]` is the current tag expected by that compose file.You can figure out what this should be by finding a line in `tests/docker-compose.yaml` like:
```
    image: ghcr.io/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER:-c3-time-domain}/seechange:${IMGTAG:-tests20240628}
```
The thing in between `${IMTAG:-` and `}` is the tagâ€” in this example, `tests20240628`.

(If you look at `docker-compose.yaml`, you will also see that it depends on the `mailhog`, image, but this is a standard image that can be pulled from `docker.io`, so you don't need to worry about it.)

Normally, all of these image should already be present in the `ghcr.io` archive, and you don't need to do anything.  However, if they aren't there, you need to build and push them.

To build and push the docker images, in the `tests` subdirectory run:
```
   IMTGAG=[tag] docker compose build
```
where [tag] is exactly what you see in the `docker-compose.yaml` file, followed by:
```
   docker push ghcr.io/c3-time-domain/upload-connector:[tag]
   docker push ghcr.io/c3-time-domain/postgres:[tag]
   docker push ghcr.io/c3-time-domain/seechange:[tag]
   docker push ghcr.io/c3-time-domain/conductor:[tag]
   docker push ghcr.io/c3-time-domain/seechange-webap:[tag]
```

(Explicitly setting `IMGTAG` isn't necessary if you don't have a `.env` file in your `tests` subdirectory, as the default will be the right thing.  However, if you _do_ have a `.env` file there, it will override the default, which is why these instructions tell you to explicitly set it.)

For this push to work, you must have the requisite permissions on the `c3-time-domain` organizaton at github.

### When making changes to dockerfiles or pip requirements

This set of docker images depend on the following files:
* `docker/application/*`
* `docker/postgres/*`
* `docker/webap/*`
* `requirements.text`

If you change any of those files, you will need to build and push new docker images.  Before doing that, edit `tests/docker-compose.yaml` and bump the date part of the tag for _every_ image, so that your changed images will only get used for your branch, and so that they will get used by other brances once your branch has been merged to main.
