            y, the psf is still rendered at the center of the returned
            image!  If you want x and y rendered somewhere else, use
            offx, offy.  (So, if what you want is a psf rendered at
            (x,y) that is the shape that the psf would have at that

            (The standard use-case for this routine is generating a psf
            image to use with fourier transforms, and you want that psf
            centered on the image to avoid convolutions in fourier space
            shifting the whole image.  In this use case, if you have a

        # is .5.  "round", with it's scary conventions about even/odd

        #  * For odd-length images : if there was no offset, then
        #    get_clip will have returned an odd-size clip with the psf
        #    centered on the center pixel of that clip.  So, we simply
        #    pad by the same amount on both sides and we get the psf
        #    centered on the final image.
        #
        #    If there was an offset, then we need to add something like
        #    (xpos-ctrx) to the left padding.  If (xpos-ctrx) is an
        #    integer, then just do that.  If the fractional part of
        #    (xpos-ctrx) is < 0.5, then it's just slide within the same
        #    pixel, so we can just add (floor(xpos-ctrx)) to the left
        #    padding.  But, if (xpos-ctrx) >= 0.5, then psf's get_clip
        #    will have rendered the PSF down and to the left of its
        #    center, so we need to add (floor(xpos-ctrx)+1) to the left

        #   To push that to the center of the final image, we need to pad
        #   the left one more than we pad the left.  It turns out
        #   That just using nx//2 - psfclip.shape[1]//2, just like we
        #   do with odd images, does the right thing here (since the //

          noisy: bool, default False

          gain: float, default 1.
            Assumed e-/adu gain for calculating Poisson statistics if
            noisy is true.

          rng: numpy.random.Generator, default None

        -------

            stamp widths for PSFs.  If x and y are integers, the PSF
            will be centered on the center pixel of the return image.
            If x and y are integers+(0.0,0.5], the PSF will be centered
            up and to the right of the center pixel of the return
