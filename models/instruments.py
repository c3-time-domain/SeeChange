# TODO: make a base Instrument class that has all the common methods.
#  Subclass it for each instrument we want to use, e.g., DECam, LS4, etc.
#  Each one of these classes must implement load and save methods.
#  There are other things we may need from an instrument, like aperture, pixel scale, etc.
