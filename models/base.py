    Mixin for objects that refer to files on disk.

    Files are assumed to live in a remote server or on local disk.
    The path to both these locations is configurable and not stored on DB!
    Once the top level directory is set (locally and remotely),
    the object's path relative to either of those is saved as "filepath".

    If multiple files need to be copied or loaded, we can also append
    the array "filepath_extensions" to the filepath.
    These could be actual extensions as in:
    filepath = 'foo.fits' and filepath_extensions=['.bias', '.dark', '.flat']
    or they could be just a different part of the filepath itself:
    filepath = 'foo_' and filepath_extensions=['bias.fits.gz', 'dark.fits.gz', 'flat.fits.gz']

    If the filepath_extensions array is null, will just load a single file.
    If the filepath_extensions is an array, will load a list of files (even if length 1).

    When calling get_fullpath(), the object will first check if the file exists locally,
    and then it will download it from server if missing.
    If no remote server is defined in the config, this part is skipped.
    If you want to avoid downloading, use get_fullpath(download=False).
    If you want to always get a list of filepaths (even if filepath_extensions=None)
    use get_fullpath(as_list=True).
    If the file is missing locally, and downloading cannot proceed
    (because no server address is defined, or because the download=False flag is used,
    or because the file is missing from server), then the call to get_fullpath() will raise an exception.

    After all the downloading is done and the file(s) exist locally,
    the full path to the local file is returned.
    It is then up to the inheriting object (e.g., the Exposure or Image)
    to actually load the file from disk and figure out what to do with the data.
