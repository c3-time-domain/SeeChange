    If multiple matching catalogs are found, will return the first
    one that the database happens to return.  (TODO: perhaps return
    the smallest one?  That would be useful if there are cameras
    with significantly different chip sizes.)

    NOTE : there is a race condition built in here.  If two
    processes ask for the same catalog at the same time (or close
    enough that the one that got there first hasn't made it and
    saved it yet), then the catalog will be grabbed twice.
    Hopefully this will be infrequent enough that the inefficiency
    of redundant catalogs won't be a big deal.  Perhaps we could put
    in some sort of locking, but that would be very touchy to do
    well without grinding everything to a halt, given that creating
    a new catalog excerpt isn't instant.

    Parameters
    ----------
      image : Image
        The Image we're searching for.  Uses the four corners to
        determine the range of RA/Dec needed for the excerpt.  Will
        make a footprint on the sky that starts with the RA/Dec
        aligned bounding square containing the image, which is then
        expanded by 5% on all sides.  Any catalog excerpt that fully
        includes that footprint is a potential match.
      minstars: int, default 50
        The minimum number of stars to require in the catalog excerpt.
      maxmags: sequence of float, default 22
        The maximum magnitudes to try pulling, using them in order
        until we get a catalog excerpt with at least minstars.
      magrange: float, default None
        If not None, then the minimum magnitude of stars fetched
        from the catalog would be this many magnitudes lower
        than the maximum magnitude.
        If None (default) there is no lower limit (the brightest
        stars will be included).
      session : sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session, optional
        If not None, use this session for communication with the
        database; otherwise, will create and close a new
        SmartSession.
      onlycached : bool, default False
        If True, only search cached excerpts, don't make a new one
        if a matching one isn't found.
