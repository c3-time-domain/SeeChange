        ---------
          image: Image
            The image to be warped.  Must be saved on disk (and perhaps
            to the database?) so that image.get_fullpath() will work.
            Assumes that the weight image will be 0 everywhere flags is

            pipeline/preprocessing.)
        
          target: Image
            The target image we're aligning with.  Won't need the data,
            but will use some information like RA, Dec.
        
          sources: SourceList
            A SourceList from the image, with good RA/Dec values

          targetsourcs: SourceList
            A SourceList from the other image to which this image should
            be aligned, with good RA/Dec values

        -------
          Image
            An image with the warped image.  image, raw_header, weight, and flags are all populated.

        # it did, and had to think about it and dig through SWarp
        # documentation to figure out why it was doing what I wanted.
        #
        # SWarp will normally align a bunch of images to the first
        # image, cropping them, and summing them, which is more (and
        # less) than what we want.  In order to get it to align a single
        # image to another single image, we rely on behavior that's
        # mentioned almost as an aftertought in the SWarp manual: "To
        # implement the unusual output features required, one must write
        # a coadd.head ASCII Ô¨Åle that contains a custom anisotropic
        # scaling matrix."  Practically speaking, we put the WCS that we
        # want the output image to have into <outim>.head.  SWarp will
        # then warp the input image so that the requested WCS will be
        # the right one for the warped image.
        #
        # We *could* just put the target image's WCS in the coadd.head
        # file, and then swarp the source image.  However, that spatial
        # transformation is the combination of two transformation
        # functions (from the source image to RA/Dec via its WCS, and
        # then from RA/Dec to the target image WCS).  It may be that the
        # Gaia WCSes we use nowadays are good enough for this, but we
        # can do better by making a *direct* transformation between the
        # two images.  To this end, we use the *source images's* source
        # list as the catalog, and use Scamp to calculate the
        # transformation necessary from the target image to the source
        # image.  The resultant WCS is now a WCS for the target image,
        # only it's using the RA/Decs calculated from the pixel
        # positions in the image's source list.  We then tell SWarp to
        # warp the source image so that it has this new WCS, and that
        # will warp the pixels so that they will give all the objects on
        # the source image the same RA/Dec that they have right now,
        # only using the WCS that was derived for the target
        # image... meaning the source image has been aligned with the
        # target image.
        #
        # (This mode of operation is not well-documented in the SWarp
        # manual, which assumes most people want to coadd with cropping,
        # or align to some sort of absolute RA/Dec projection, but it
