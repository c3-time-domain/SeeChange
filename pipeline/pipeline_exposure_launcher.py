        Parameters
        ----------
        cluster_id : str
           The id of the cluster that this ExposureLauncher is running on

        node_id : str
           The id of the node within the cluster that this ExposureLauncher is running on

        numprocs : int or None
           The number of worker processes to run (in addition to a
           single manager process).  Make this 0 if you want to run
           this single-threaded, with the actual work happening
           serially in the manager process.  Normally, you want to
           make this the number of CPUs you have minus one (for the
           manager process), but you might make it less if you have
           e.g. memory limitations.  if this is None, it will ask the
           system for the number of physical (not logical) CPUs and
           set this value to that minus one.

        verify : bool, default True
           Make this False if the conductor doesn't have a properly
           signed SSL certificate and you really know what you're
           doing.  (Normally, this is only False within self-contained
           test environments, and should never be False in
           production.)

        onlychips : list, default None
          If not None, will only process the sensor sections whose names
          match something in this list.  If None, will process all
          sensor sections returned by the instrument's get_section_ids()
          class method.

        through_step : str or None
          Parameter passed on to top_level.py::Pipeline, unless it is "exposure"
          in which case all we do is download the exposure and load it into the
          database.  The conductor may also give us a through step.  The pipeline
          will run through the *earlier* of this parameter, or the parameter
          passed by the conductor, if both are present.

        max_run_time : float, default None
          Normally, when you call an ExposureLauncher it will loop
          forever, asking the conductor for things to do.  If you set
          this, it will run at most this many seconds before exiting.
          Before asking the conductor for something to do, it will check
          to see that it hasn't been running this long, and if it has,
          it will exit.

        worker_log_level : log level, default logging.WARNING
          The log level for the worker processes.  Here so that you can
          have a different log level for the overall control process
          than in the individual processes that run the actual pipeline.
