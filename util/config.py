class Config:
    """Interface for yaml config file.

    Read a yaml file that might include other yaml files, and provide an
    interface. The top level of the yaml must be a dict. Only supports
    dicts, lists, and scalars.


    USAGE

    1. Optional: call Config.init(filename)

    2. Instantiate a config object with

           confobj = Config.get()
       or

           confobj = Config.get(filename)

       in the former case, it will get the default file.  (That's the
       file that was passed to Config.init, or specified to the first
       .get call.)  You can't do the first one if you haven't done the
       second one yet, or if you haven't called Config.init yet.  Do NOT
       call __init__ (i.e. don't say confobj = Config() or
       Config(filename)).

    3. Get a config value with

           configval = confobj.value( fieldspec )

       where fieldspec is just the field for a scalar, or .-separated
       fields for lists and dicts.  For lists, it must be a (0-offset)
       integer index.  For example, if the yaml files includes:

         storage:
           images:
             format: fits
             single_file: false
             name_convention: "{inst_name}_{date}_{time}_{section_id}_{filter}_{im_type}_{prov_hash:.6s}"

       then confobj.value("storage.images.format") will return
       "fits". You can also ask configobj.value for higher levels.  For
       example, config.value("storage.images") will return a dictionary:
          { "format": "fits",
            "single_file": False,
            "name_convention": "{inst_name}_{date}_{time}_{section_id}_{filter}_{im_type}_{prov_hash:.6s}"
          }

    4. Change a config value with

           confobj.set_value( fieldspec, value )

       This only changes it for the running session, it does *not*
       affect the YAML files in storage.


    CONFIG FILES

    This class reads yaml files (which can have other included yaml
    file).  The top level structure of a config file must be a
    dictionary.

    When reading a config file, it is processed as follows:

    The "current working config" starts as an empty dictionary ({}).
    When everything is done, it can be a big messy hierarchy.  Each key
    of the top level dictionary can have a value that is a scalar, a
    list, or a dictionary.  The structure is recursive; each element of
    each list can be a scalar, a list, or a dictionary, and the value
    associated with each key in each dictionary can itself be a scalar,
    a list, or a dictionary.

    A config file has three special keys: preloads, augments, and
    overrides.  The value associated with each key is a list of file
    paths relative to the directory where this file is found.

    preloads is a list of files that are read, in order, *before* the
       current config file, populating the current working config.
       Files later in the list override files earlier in the list.

    The current file is parsed next.  It overrides anything in the
       current working config (which will have been built from preload,
       if any).

    augments is a list of files that are read next.  Those files are
       read in order, and augment the current working config.

    overrides is a list off files that are read last.  Those files are
       read in order, and override the current working config.

    Any file that's read can itself have preloads, augments, and
    overrides.  IMPORTANT: there is no circular inclusion detection, so
    if you say file A augments file B and file B augments file A, you
    will get stuck in an infinite recursion when you try to read the
    config.  This will either lead to a python crash because it detects
    too many recursion levels, or to a process crash if you run out of
    memory, or to the end of the local Universe as you create a
    singularity and nucleate a new Big Bang.  Just don't do that.  Keep
    it simple.

    Above, the words "augment" and "override" were used to describe how
    to combine information from two different files.  Exactly what
    happens is complicated; if you *really* want to know, see

      util/config.py::Config._merge_trees()

    Here's an attempt to define it:

    augment
       When one config tree (the "right" tree) "augments" another (the
       "left" tree), generally speaking, stuff in the right tree is
       added to stuff in the left tree, but of course it's more
       complicated than that.  The augment process walks down the trees,
       from top to bottom.  It starts at the very top level, where the
       left dictionary and right dictionary are compared.

          * If the current item being compared have different types
            (scalar vs. list vs. dict), the new value *replaces* the old
            values.  This will never happen at the very top level,
            because both left and right are dictionaries at the top
            level.

          * If the item being compared is a dictionary, then merge the
            two dictionaries.  Keys in the right that don't show up in
            the left key have their key:value added wholesale to
            the left item.  If a key shows up in both the left and
            right trees, then recurse.  (So, the value of right[key]
            augments the value of left[key].)

          * If the item being compared is a list, then then the
            right list extends the left list.  (Literally using
            list.extend().)

          * If the item being compared is a scalar, then the right
            value replaces the left value.

    override
       When one config tree (the "right" tree) "overrides" another (the
       "left" tree), generally speaking, stuff in the right tree
       replaces stuff in the left tree.  The override process walks down
       the trees, from top ot bottom.  It starts at the very top level,
       where the left dictionary and the right dictionary are compared.

          * If the current item being compared have different types
            (scalar vs. list vs. dict), the new value *replaces* the old
            values.  This will never happen at the very top level,
            because both left and right are dictionaries at the top
            level.  This is exactly the same behavior as in augment.

          * If the current item being compared is a dictionary, then
            the dictionaries are merged in exactly the same manner
            as "augment", with the modification that recursing down
            into the dictionary passes along the fact that we're
            overriding rather than augmenting.

          * If the current item being compared is a list, then the
            right list *replaces* the left list.  (This could
            potentially throw away a gigantic hierarchy if lists
            and dicts and scalars from the left wide, which is as
            designed.)

          * If the item being compared is a scalar, then the right value

    This can be very confusing, so keeping your config overrides and
    augments simple is likely what you want.


   WARNINGS

    * Won't work with any old yaml file.  Top level must be a dictionary.
      Don't name your dictionary fields as numbers, as the code will then
      detect it as a list rather than a dict.

    * The yaml parser seems to be parsing "yyyy-mm-dd" strings as a
      datetime.date; beware.

    * python's yaml reading of floats is broken.  It will read 1e10 as a
      string, not a float.  Write 1.0e+10 to make it work right.  There
      are two things here: the first is the + after e (which, I think
      *is* part of the yaml spec, even though we can freely omit that +
      in Python and C).  The second is the decimal point; the YAML spec
      says it's not necessary, but python won't recognize it as a float
      without it.

        Parameters
        -----------
        configfile : str or Pathlib.Path, default None
            The config file to read (if it hasn't been read before, or
            if reread is True).  If None, will return the default config
            context for the current session (which is normally the one
            in the file pointed to by environment variable
            SEECHANGE_CONFIG, but see "setdefault" below.  If that env
            var is needed but not set, then an exception will be
            raised).

        setdefault : bool, default None
            Avoid use of this, as it is mucking about with global
            variables and as such can cause confusion.  If True, set the
            Config object read by this method to be the session default
            config.  If False, never set the Config object read by this
            method to be the session default config.  If not specified,
            which is usually what you want, then if configfile is None,
            the configfile in SEECHANGE_CONFIG will be read and set to
            the be the session default Config; if configfile is not
            None, read that config file, but don't make it the session
            default config.

            Normal usage of Config is to make a call early on to either
            Config.init() or Config.get() without parameters.  That will
            read the config file in SEECHANGE_CONFIG and make that the
            default config for the process.  If, for some reason, you
            want to read a different config file and make that the
            default config file for the process, then pass a configfile
            here and make setdefault True.  If, for some truly perverse
            reason, you want to the config in SEECHANGE_CONFIG but not
            set it to the session default, then call
            Config.get(setdefault=False), and question your life
            choices.

        static : bool, default True
            If True (the default), then you get one of the config object
            singletons described below.  In this case, it is not
            permitted to modify the config.  If False, you get back a
            clone of the config singleton, and that clone is not stored
            anywhere other than the return value.  In this case, you may
            modify the config.  Call Config.get(static=False) to get a
            modifiable version of the default config.

        Returns
        -------
            Config object

        Config objects are stored as an array of singletons (as class
        variables of the Config class).  That is, if you pass a config
        file that has been passed before in the current execution
        context, you'll get back exactly the same object each time
        (unless static is True).  If you pass a config file that hasn't
        been passed before, it will read the indicated configuration
        file, cache an object associated with it for future calls, and
        return that object (unless static is True, in which case the the
        object is still cached, but you get a copy of that object).

        If you don't pass a config file, then you will get back the
        default config object.  If there is no default config object
        (because neither Config.get() nor Config.init() have been called
        previously), and if the class is not configured with a "default
        default", then an exception will be raised.
