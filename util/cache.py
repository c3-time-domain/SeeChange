    If the object is a FileOnDiskMixin, then the file(s) pointed by
    get_fullpath() will be copied to the cache directory with their
    original names, unless filepath is specified, in which case the
    cached files will have a different name than the files in the data
    folder (and the database filepath).  The object's filepath attribute
    will be used to create a JSON file which holds the object's column
    attributes (i.e., only those that are database persistent).

    If caching a non-FileOnDiskMixin object, the filepath argument must
    be given, because it is used to name the JSON file.

    The object must implement a method to_json(path) that serializes
    itself to the file specified by path.

    ----------
    FoD: FileOnDiskMixin or another object that implements to_json()

    cache_dir: str or path

        Must be underneath cache_dir.  May either be the full absolute
        path (i.e. including cache_dir), or relative to cache_dir.

    add_to_dict: dict (optional)
        Additional parameters to add to the dictionary pulled from the
        cache.  Add things here that aren't saved to the cache but that
        are necessary in order to instantiate the object.  Things here will
        also override anything read from the cache.

    symlink : bool, default False
        Only relevant if copying an object that has stored files
        (i.e. something that is a FileOnDiskMixin).  If True, instead
        of copying, will make a symbolic link for all of those stored
        files rather than fully copying them from the cache.
