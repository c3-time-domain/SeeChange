# Functions for copying FileOnDisk objects to/from cache


def copy_to_cache(FoD, cache_dir, filepath=None):
    """Save a copy of the object (and, potentially, associated files) into a cache directory.

    If the object is a FileOnDiskMixin, then the file(s) pointed by get_fullpath()
    will be copied to the cache directory with their original names,
    unless filepath is specified, in which case the cached files will
    have a different name than the files in the data folder (and the database filepath).
    The filepath (with optional first extension) will be used to create a JSON file
    which holds the object's column attributes (i.e., only those that are
    database persistent).

    If caching a non-FileOnDiskMixin object, the filepath argument must
    be given, because it is used to name the JSON file.  The object must
    implement a method to_json(path) that serializes itself to the file
    specified by path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    FoD: FileOnDiskMixin or another object that implements to_json()
        The object to cache.
    cache_dir: str or path
        The path to the cache directory.
    filepath: str or path (optional)
        Must be given if the FoD is None.
        If it is a FileOnDiskMixin, it will be used to name

    All objects must be of the same type.  If they are of type

    Cutouts where a whole bunch of objects all have the same file.)

    The objects implement the to_dict() method that serializes

    objects' dictionary data will be written to filepath as a JSON list
    of dictionaries.

    In either case, if the objects have a "filepath" attribute, the

    Those files will be copied into the current data directory

    The reconstructed object should be correctly associated
    with its files but will not necessarily have the correct
    relationships to other objects.

    WARNING : this caches database records to json files, including
    values of things that are determined automatically (e.g. ids set
    from database sequences) or that are foreign ids whose values depend
    on the history of what was built into the database, and which may
    well not be the same when the object is restored from the cache.  As
    such, anything that uses this cache needs to very carefully go
    thorugh all fields like that and make sure that they're wiped!

    Parameters
