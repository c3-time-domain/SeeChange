# util/githash.py is automatically generated
#  by util/Makefile.am, and is needed by
#  installed code that isn't a git checkout.
#  Because it's automatically generated, it
#  should *not* be in the archive.
util/githash.py


### Stuff created by autoconf and ./configure
# THOUGHT REQUIRED : do we want to add the various
#   Makefile.in files from autoconf to the archive?
#   That's often what people do.  Right now,
#   installation requires rerunning autoconf,
#   which can be inconvenient.  If we ever
#   want to drop that requirement, then we
#   need to remove some of these following lines
Makefile
Makefile.in
aclocal.m4
