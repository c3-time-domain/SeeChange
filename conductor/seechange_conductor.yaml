# To customize it for where you're actually running the conductor,
# before building the docker image, edit the file local_overrides.yaml
# in this directory and put in the relevant confing.

# The conductor will not be using these,
#  but it has to have something because
#  startup code that will get run upon
#  module import is going to try to
#  make sure these directories exist, using
#  defaults that turn out not to be
#  writeable if they don't exist.
